# Immich Updater

Simple and dumb Immich server updater.

Compares the current server version with the version of the latest release on Github. If there has been a major version update **OR** the release notes say "breaking change" (case-insensitive) anywhere, then it aborts. Otherwise, if there has been a version change, will do `docker pull`, `docker compose up -d`.

## Limitations

This script is **DUMB**!

It's literally looking for a string in the release notes.

Also, this script only looks at the notes of the LATEST release. That means that it needs to be run often (daily? weekly?) to make sure that it does not miss a "breaking change" release between runs.

## Installation & Running

1. Copy the script to a location of your choice. I recommend `/etc/cron.daily/` or `/etc/cron.weekly/` so that it runs on a schedule (see Limitations).
   - remember to take the extension off the file name, or the script will not be executed.
1. Edit variables at the top of the script to suit your needs:
   - `IMMICH_DIR` is the location of your Immich docker-compose.yml.
   - `DELAY_DAYS` allows you to wait some days after a new release, before updating.
1. Make it executable.

If there is nothing to do, there is no output. Anything else prints messages to STDOUT.
